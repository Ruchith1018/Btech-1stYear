# DNA to Protein Converter

This project is a DNA to Protein Converter, developed during my 1st year of [Your Course Name]. The program is written in Python and translates a DNA sequence into a corresponding protein sequence by following the genetic code.

## Features

- **DNA Input:** Accepts a DNA sequence as input.
- **Translation:** Converts the DNA sequence into a protein sequence based on codon mappings.
- **Output:** Displays the resulting protein sequence.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - `Biopython` (if used)
  - `re` (Regular Expressions for sequence validation)

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for reading DNA sequences from a file.
- Implement error handling for invalid DNA sequences.
- Add options for different reading frames and reverse translation.
