# Stacker Game Application

This project is a Stacker Game Application, developed during my 1st year. The game was implemented using the Jack programming language, offering a hands-on experience with low-level programming and understanding of basic game mechanics.

## Features

- **Basic Gameplay:** A stacker game where the player tries to align blocks to reach the top.
- **Win Condition:** If the player successfully stacks all blocks to the top, they win.
- **Game Over:** If the blocks fall out of alignment, the game ends.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Jack Programming Language
- **Platform:** [Nand2Tetris, or any other relevant tools.]

## Future Enhancements

- Add levels with increasing difficulty.
- Implement a scoring system based on player performance.
- Introduce sound effects and animations for a more engaging experience.
